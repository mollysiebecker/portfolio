# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
## Overview
This project explores the relationship between home characteristics and sale prices using a dataset provided as part of a Kaggle competition. The analysis includes probability, statistics, linear algebra, PCA, and modeling. Final predictions were submitted to Kaggle.

## Key Methods
### Probability & Association:

Conditional and joint probabilities (P(X>x | Y>y), etc.)

Chi-square test showed strong association between lot size and sale price.

### Statistics:

95% confidence interval for difference in mean sale prices by lot size.

Correlation matrix and 99% confidence intervals confirmed moderate correlation between living area and sale price.

### PCA:

Identified key components explaining variance.

### Distribution Fitting:

Fitted exponential distribution to LotArea and compared percentiles.
